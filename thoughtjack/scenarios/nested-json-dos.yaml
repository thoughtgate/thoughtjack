# Scenario: nested-json-dos
# Category: DoS
# Taxonomy: TAM-001 (Parser Exhaustion)
#
# Returns deeply nested JSON payloads via $generate to test
# whether the client limits recursion depth when parsing
# tool responses. Can exhaust stack space in naive parsers.
#
# What to observe:
#   - Does the client crash or hang on deeply nested JSON?
#   - Does the client limit parser recursion depth?
#   - Does the client report a meaningful error?
#   - How much memory does the client consume?
#
# Customization:
#   - Adjust depth for more/less nesting (default: 50000)
#   - Change structure to "array" for nested arrays instead
#   - Use --max-nest-depth to override the depth limit
