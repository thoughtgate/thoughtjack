# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
# Scenario: notification-flood
# Category: DoS
# Taxonomy: TAM-006 (Notification Flood)
#
# Floods the client with server-initiated notifications on
# every tool call. Tests whether the client implements rate
# limiting or backpressure for server notifications.
#
# What to observe:
#   - Does the client rate-limit incoming notifications?
#   - Does the client queue or drop excess notifications?
#   - Does the UI become unresponsive under notification load?
#   - Does the client disconnect under flood conditions?
#
# Customization:
#   - Adjust rate_per_sec / duration_sec for more/less flood
#   - Change the tool definition to trigger different scenarios
#   - Add --behavior response_delay to slow initial response
