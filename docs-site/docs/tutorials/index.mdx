# Tutorials

Learn ThoughtJack from the ground up with these step-by-step tutorials. Each tutorial walks you through a complete workflow, from installation to observing results.

## Where to start

If you're new to ThoughtJack, begin with **Getting Started** — it takes about 5 minutes and gives you a working feel for the tool.

| Tutorial | What you'll learn |
|----------|-------------------|
| [Getting Started](./getting-started) | Install ThoughtJack, run your first scenario, understand the output |
| [Writing a Custom Scenario](./custom-scenario) | Create a YAML config from scratch with tools, phases, and triggers |
| [Building Phased Attacks](./phased-attacks) | Multi-phase trust-building → trigger → exploit with `replace_tools` |
| [Generating Documentation](./generating-docs) | Auto-generate a documentation site from your scenarios |

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (1.85+) or a pre-built binary
- An MCP client to test against (or just observe ThoughtJack's stdout)
- Basic familiarity with YAML

## What these tutorials are not

These are **learning-oriented** guides that walk you through complete workflows. If you need:

- **Task-specific instructions** → see [How-To Guides](/docs/how-to)
- **Complete field reference** → see [Reference](/docs/reference)
- **Conceptual background** → see [Explanation](/docs/explanation)
