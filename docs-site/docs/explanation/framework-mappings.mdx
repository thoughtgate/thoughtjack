# Security Framework Mappings

ThoughtJack scenarios map to established security frameworks to help security teams prioritize testing and communicate findings using shared taxonomy.

## MITRE ATT&CK

[MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) is a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques. ThoughtJack scenarios map to ATT&CK techniques where MCP-specific attacks parallel traditional attack patterns.

### Why ATT&CK mapping matters

- **Shared language**: security teams already understand ATT&CK; mapping MCP attacks to it reduces the learning curve
- **Coverage analysis**: identify which ATT&CK techniques your MCP client is vulnerable to
- **Risk prioritization**: ATT&CK techniques have associated severity and prevalence data

### Mapping approach

MCP attacks don't always have direct ATT&CK equivalents. ThoughtJack maps to the closest applicable technique:

| MCP Attack | ATT&CK Technique | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Prompt injection in tool responses | T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) | Injected instructions cause the agent to execute actions |
| Tool description injection | T1036 (Masquerading) | Malicious tool disguised as legitimate |
| Credential harvesting via descriptions | T1556 (Modify Authentication Process) | Social engineering through tool interfaces |
| Rug pull (tool swap) | T1574 (Hijack Execution Flow) | Legitimate tool replaced with malicious version |
| Resource exfiltration | T1552 (Unsecured Credentials) | Data extracted via resource content |
| Unicode obfuscation | T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information) | Content disguised using Unicode tricks |
| Notification flood | T1498 (Network Denial of Service) | Resource exhaustion via message volume |
| Nested JSON DoS | T1499 (Endpoint Denial of Service) | Parser resource exhaustion |

### Limitations

ATT&CK was designed for traditional computing environments. Some MCP-specific attacks have no direct parallel:

- **Escalation ladders** — gradual trust manipulation over multiple calls
- **`list_changed` abuse** — exploiting MCP's dynamic capability protocol
- **Bidirectional protocol attacks** — exploiting the server's ability to send unsolicited messages

ThoughtJack maps these to the closest technique but notes where the mapping is approximate.

## OWASP MCP Top 10

The OWASP MCP Top 10 is a categorization of risks specific to Model Context Protocol implementations.

### Mapping

| OWASP MCP ID | Risk | ThoughtJack scenarios |
|-------------|------|----------------------|
| MCP-01 | Tool Injection | `rug-pull`, `prompt-injection` |
| MCP-02 | Resource Poisoning | `resource-exfiltration`, `resource-rug-pull` |
| MCP-03 | Capability Mutation | `rug-pull`, `resource-rug-pull` |
| MCP-04 | Prompt Injection via Tools | `prompt-injection`, `credential-harvester` |
| MCP-05 | Data Exfiltration | `resource-exfiltration` |
| MCP-06 | Denial of Service | `slow-loris`, `nested-json-dos`, `notification-flood` |
| MCP-07 | Protocol Abuse | `notification-flood` (batch amplify, pipe deadlock) |
| MCP-08 | Unicode/Encoding Attacks | `unicode-obfuscation` |
| MCP-09 | Trust Boundary Violation | `rug-pull`, `escalation-ladder` |
| MCP-10 | Credential Theft | `credential-harvester` |

### Coverage matrix

ThoughtJack's documentation site includes an auto-generated coverage matrix showing which scenarios cover which framework entries. Generate it with:

```bash
thoughtjack docs generate --output-dir docs-site/docs/scenarios
```

The matrix helps identify:
- Which risks have scenario coverage
- Which risks need additional scenarios
- How thoroughly each risk is tested

## Using mappings in reports

When reporting test results, reference both frameworks:

```
Finding: MCP client follows injected instructions in tool responses
Scenario: prompt-injection
MITRE ATT&CK: T1059.004 (Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell)
OWASP MCP: MCP-04 (Prompt Injection via Tools)
Severity: High
```

This provides context that security teams can act on regardless of which framework they prefer.

## Adding mappings to custom scenarios

When creating custom scenarios, include framework mappings in the `metadata` block:

```yaml
metadata:
  id: "my-scenario"
  name: "My Custom Attack"
  category: "injection"
  mitre_attack:
    - "T1059.004"
  owasp_mcp:
    - "MCP-04"
```

See [Scenario Metadata Schema](/docs/reference/scenarios-metadata) for the complete field reference.
